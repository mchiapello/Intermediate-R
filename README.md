# Intermediate R

### Course Description

Welcome to Intermediate R\! This short course builds onto the [Intro to
R](https://github.com/uc-r/Intro-R) course and provides a hands-on
approach to using the R programming language for data science
applications. In this course you will learn about various workflow
approaches, scoped variable transformation, control flow, iteration with
loops, iteration with functional programming, and how to write *good*
functions. The following is an outline of the material covered in this
training:

### Course Preparation

To prepare for this course please complete the following ***prior*** to
the day of class:

1.  Download the class material
    [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cafgzwtd7hbpz50/AABxrvnAqAwVU0rCCy55omg2a?dl=1).
    This will provide you with the data and scripts to follow along
    during class. Be sure to unzip the file otherwise you will have run
    issues.

2.  All slides are available via the hyperlinks in the schedule above so
    that you can follow along.

3.  Please have the following versions of R and RStudio installed. If
    you have an earlier version of R that is at least version 3.4.5 or
    later you should be ok but its best to be as current as possible.
    
      - R: 3.5.2 \[[download latest
        version](https://cran.r-project.org/)\]
      - RStudio: 1.1.463 \[[download latest
        version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\]

4.  Run the `00-run-this-script-first.R` script to make sure you have
    all the required packages for this course. If you run into any
    problems just let me know.

5.  This course makes some assumptions about your prior knowledge. To
    ensure your success, be sure that you have reviewed and are
    comfortable with the material covered in the [Intro to
    R](https://github.com/uc-r/Intro-R) course.

If you have any specific questions prior to the class you can reach out
to me (Brad Boehmke) directly at <bradleyboehmke@gmail.com>.
